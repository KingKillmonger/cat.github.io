    <h1>Passive Income Ideas You Can Use to Build Real Wealth</h1>

<div class="container">

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p class="lead">Passive income is highly sought after and often misunderstood. <br><br>

                Passive income streams require an upfront investment and a lot of nurturing in the beginning. After some time and hard work these income streams start to build and are able to maintain themselves, bringing you consistent revenue without much effort on your part. <br><br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img src="MakeMoneyImages/Rich%20Relaxing.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="lead">Speaking from personal experience, adding passive income streams to your portfolio can help you increase your earnings and accelerate your financial goals in tremendous ways. <br><br>

            For example, you can use passive income streams to help you get out of debt or achieve financial independence sooner. Like Fundrise - you can start investing in real estate for just $500. It's one of our favorite ways to build passive income. <br><br

            Promo Offer; UFB Direct. This account currently pays 1.90% APY, which is one of the highest interest rates you can get with just a $25,000 minimum. Open a UFB Direct account here >> <br><br>

            If you want to get started earning passive income here’s what you should know first. <br><br>

            If you want to skip straight to the ideas, here you go: <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>What It Takes To Earn Passive Income</h2>

        <p class="lead">Before we get into the passive income ideas I think it’s a good idea to first clear up a couple of misconceptions. Although the word “passive” makes it sound like you have to do nothing to bring in the income this just isn’t true. All passive income streams will require at least one of the following two elements: <br><br>

            1) An upfront monetary investment, or <br>

            2) An upfront time investment <br>

            You can’t earn residual income without being willing to provide at least one of these two. Today, I have a big list of passive income ideas you can try regardless of the category you fall in. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Passive Income Ideas Requiring an Upfront Monetary Investment</h2>

        <p class="lead">These types of passive income require you to invest money up front to generate the passive income later. Don't be alarmed though - you can start with as little as $5 with some of these ideas, so it's achievable for everyone. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>1. Dividend Stocks</h2>

        <p class="lead"> Dividend stocks are tried and true way to earn passive income. You will have to do plenty of research to find good stocks and invest a significant amount of money to receive large dividend checks. However, if you consistently invest money into dividend stocks you can amass a nice residual income over time. <br><br>

            For any of these investment opportunities, make sure you open an account at the best online brokerage, and get rewards while doing it. <br><br>

            Our favorite place to invest is M1 Finance. You might not have heard of M1 Finance, but it's a FREE investing platform that allows you to build a portfolio, and invest in it for free. <br><br>

            This is amazing for investing in dividend stocks because you can build your portfolio of, say, 30 stocks. Then, your investments will be auto-allocated to your entire portfolio every deposit - for FREE! You can even auto-rebalance. Then, your dividends can also be reinvested. It's a fantastic platform, and it was made for this. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Peer to Peer Lending</h2>

        <p class="lead">P2P lending is the practice of loaning money to borrowers who typically don’t qualify for traditional loans. As the lender you have the ability to choose the borrowers and are able to spread your investment amount out to mitigate your risk. The most popular peer to peer lending platform is Lending Club. You can read our full lending club review here: Lending Club Review. <br><br>

            What's great about Lending Club is that investors are earning 4-6% returns on average - and that's all passive income. You simply lend your money, and you get paid back principal and interest on that loan. <br><br>

            The median return on cash flow is 4.1% - which is better than any money market fund you're going to find today. This also makes Lending Club my favorite CD alternative. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Rental Properties</h2>

        <p class="lead">A cash flowing rental property is a fantastic way to bring in a monthly income. To make this truly passive you can outsource the running of the properties to a management company.  <br><br>

            However, the internet has made investing in rental properties easier than ever before. There are a lot of ways you can invest in rental properties depending on what your goals and interests are. You can be a limited partner in large residential or commercial properties, or you can buy homes and be a landlord - all online! <br><br>

            If you're looking for a more traditional path to real estate investment, check out ​Roofstock. This company allows you to buy cash-flow positive single family rentals - online! You can sign up and start searching properties today. Check out Roofstock here. <br><br>

            The great thing about using a platform versus doing it yourself is that the income is even more passive. Check out our full Roofstock review here. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>4. High Yield Savings Accounts And Money Market Funds</h2>

        <p class="lead">If you don't want to think much about your money, but want it to work for you, a basic place to put it is in a high yield savings account or money market fund. <br><br>

            The difference is in the account type and where it's located. Typically, high yield savings accounts are located at banks, and are FDIC insured. Money market funds can be located at both banks and investment companies, and are only sometimes FDIC insured. <br><br>

            Interest rates have been rising, so putting more money into a savings account can generate a safe passive income stream. <br><br>

            CIT Bank consistently has a compelling savings account offer, with a 1.80% APY and no fees, and FDIC insurance. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>5. CD Ladders</h2>

        <p class="lead">Building a CD Ladder requires buying CDs (certificates of deposits) from banks in certain increments so that you can earn a higher return on your money. CDs are offered by banks and since they are a low risk investment they also yield a low return. This is a good option for the risk averse. <br><br>

            For example, what you do if you want a five-year CD ladder is you do the following. Look how the rates rise over different time periods (these are estimated): <br><br>

            1 Year CD - 2.50% <br>
            2 Year CD - 2.90% <br>
            3 Year CD - 3.05% <br>
            4 Year CD - 3.10% <br>
            5 Year CD - 3.15% <br>

            If building a CD Ladder sounds complicated, you can also stick to a traditional high yield savings account or money market fund. While the returns aren't as amazing as other things on this list, it's better than nothing, and it's truly passive income! <br><br>

            We recommend building a CD Ladder at CIT Bank because they have one of the best CD products available. High rates and even a penalty-free CD option. Check out CIT Bank here. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>6. Annuities</h2>

        <p class="lead">Annuities are an insurance product that you pay for but can then provide you passive income for life in the form of monthly payments. The terms with annuities vary and are not always a great deal so it’s best to talk to a trusted financial advisor if you’re interested in purchasing an annuity. <br><br>

            These investments aren't for everyone - they can come with high fees, and not be worth it. But if you have zero risk tolerance for loss, and are looking for a passive income stream, this could be a good potential idea for you your portfolio. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>7. Invest Automatically In The Stock Market</h2>

        <p class="lead">If you're not interested in picking dividend paying stocks (and I can understand that), there are still ways to invest passively in the stock market. You can automatically invest in various ways through what's called a robo-advisor. <br><br>

            A robo-advisor is just like what it sounds like - a robotic financial advisor. You spend about 10 minutes answering a few questions and setting up your account, and the system will take it from there. <br><br>

            The most popular robo-advisor is Betterment - which you can setup to automatically invest in and they will handle the rest for you. What's great about Betterment is that they charge one of the lowest fees in the robo-advisor industry, and they make it really easy to invest automatically.  <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>8. Invest In A REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)</h2>

        <p class="lead">If you're concerned about investing directly in real estate, or maybe you're not yet an accredited investor, that's okay. You can still take advantage of real estate in your investments through REITs - Real Estate Investment Trusts. <br><br>

            These are investment vehicles that hold property within them - and you as the owner get to benefit from the gains, refinances, sale, income (or loss) on the property. <br><br>

            Our favorite platform to invest in a REIT is FundRise. They only have a $500 minimum to get started and offer a variety of options we love as well! FundRise has really been a great performing passive income investment over the last year! <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>9. Refinance Your Mortgage</h2>

        <p class="lead">This may sound strange in a passive income article, but refinancing your mortgage can be a great way to free up a lot of income and save you $100,000s over the life of your loan. That's a pretty good gain in my book. <br><br>

            Right now, interest rates are still near historic lows, and if you haven't checked out your mortgage lately, now's a great time to shop around and compare rates. If you can save 0.50% or more on your loan, you're potentially adding tens of thousands of dollars back into your pocket. Not many investments can beat that. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>10. Pay Off Or Reduce Debt</h2>

        <p class="lead">Along the same lines as refinancing your mortgage, if you can pay off or reduce your debt, you're making huge progress in building income. But just like other things in this topic - it takes a monetary investment to make that happen. <br><br>

            The great thing about paying off debt is that it's a straight return. If you have a credit card at 10% interest, paying it off is a 10% return on your money! That's huge. <br><br>

            There's two approaches you can take with debt: refinance or consolidate, or balance transfer and pay down. <br><br>

            If you have student loan debt, it could make a lot of sense to refinance the debt. You can see if it makes sense in 2 minutes at Credible without a hard credit check. If you decide to proceed, College Investor readers get up to a $750 gift card bonus when they refinance through this link. <br><br>

            If you have credit cards or other debt, it can make sense to consolidate with a personal loan. This is typically the best option when you can't see yourself paying off the debt in a year, but want to lower your interest. Credible also allows you to compare personal loan options, so check it out here and see if it makes sense. <br><br>

            Finally, you could get a 0% balance transfer card and use your 0% time to pay off the debt. There are some credit cards right now that offer 15 months at 0% with no fees - that gives you over a year to pay off your debt. Learn more about these cards here. <br><br>
