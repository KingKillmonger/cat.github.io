<h1>Secret Ways To Get Student Loan Forgiveness</h1>

            <p class="lead">It's estimated that roughly 50% of student loan borrowers qualify for some type of student loan forgiveness program.  But this statistic is misleading, because a lot of borrowers think this means qualifying for some type of student loan forgiveness program.  That's wrong.</p>

    <p class="lead">Actually, most borrowers qualify for student loan forgiveness through one of these "secret" ways.  The secret is simple: sign up for a qualifying student loan repayment plan, and any remaining balance on your loan will be forgiven at the end of the plan. <br><br>
        It's that simple.  What's even better is that your income could be low enough to qualify for zero or minimal repayment, at which your loan will be forgiven at the end. Yes, there may be tax consequences, but that shouldn't deter you from these programs. It is the best alternative if you can't afford your loans and you are looking for forgiveness options (and we discuss the taxes a bit at the end of the article). <br><br>
        If you're not quite sure where to start or what to do, check out LoanBuddy! It's a tool that can help you find the lowest repayment plan, see your forgiveness options, and a lot more! <br><br>
        Here are the student loan repayment plans that qualify for student loan forgiveness: <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>1. Income Based Repayment Plan (IBR)</h3>
    <p class="lead">The Income Based Repayment Plan (IBR) is one of the most common repayment plans borrowers switch to if they are having financial hardship.  If you have loans from before July 1, 2014, you payment will not be higher than 15% of your discretionary income.  On this plan, you will make payments for 25 years, and at that point, your loans will be forgiven. <br><br>

        If you are a borrower with loans after July 1, 2014, your loan will not exceed 10% of your discretionary income, and the loan will be forgiven after just 20 years. <br><br>

        With IBR, you loan repayment will never exceed the payment of the 10 year standard repayment plan, and your loan will also be forgiven at the end of the term.<br><br>

        The actual amount of your "discretionary income" is determined by a formula based on your family size and income tax returns.  Check out our Discretionary Income Calculator to find out what your discretionary income would be.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (PAYE)</h3>

    <p class="lead">The Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (PAYE) is very similar to the IBR Plan.  With PAYE, you will not pay more than 10% of your discretionary income, and your loan will also be forgiven after 20 years. This program is also sometimes referred to as Obama Student Loan Forgiveness. <br><br>

        The key difference is that certain loans going back to 2007 qualify for this plan.<br><br>

        With PAYE, you loan repayment will never exceed the payment of the 10 year standard repayment plan, and your loan will also be forgiven at the end of the term. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>3. Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (RePAYE)</h3>
    <p class="lead">RePAYE is a modified version of PAYE that has become available to borrowers after December 17, 2015. Unlike PAYE, which was available for loans taken out after 2007, RePAYE is open to all Direct Loan Borrowers, regardless of when the loan was taken out. The repayment plan still caps your payment at 10% of your discretionary income, and the loan will be forgiven after 20 years.<br><br>

        The RePAYE plan also includes an interest subsidy that would help cover 50% of the interest in cases where the new payments cannot keep up with the accruing interest.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Income Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR)</h3>
    <p class="lead">The Income Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR) is a little different than IBR or PAYE.  There are no initial income requirements for ICR, and any eligible buyer may make payments under this plan.  Under this plan, your payments will be the lesser of the following: <br><br>

        *20% of your discretionary income
        *What you would pay on a repayment plan with a fixed payment over the course of 12 years, adjusted according to your income <br><br>

        With the ICR plan, your loans will be forgiven at the end of 25 years. <br><br>

        It's important to note that with this plan, your payments could end up being higher than the standard 10 year repayment plan. Since you have to submit your income every year, if your income rises high enough, your payment will adjust accordingly. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>5. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</h3>
    <p class="lead">This isn't a secret, but this is one of the most popular ways to currently get loan forgiveness. It has nothing to do with your repayment plan, however, if you're smart, you'll combine IBR or PAYE with PSLF to get the maximum benefit. <br><br>

        A lot of people have been worried about what the future of Public Service Loan Forgiveness would be. We have a full break down of the Trump Student Loan Forgiveness Proposals that highlight the key changes. In general, loans issued before June 30, 2019 should be grandfathered in - so if you're a borrower right now, you shouldn't worry too much. <br><br>
